## About The Project

This project challenges the team to design and build an application to manage a financial portfolio. The primary goal is to create a Portfolio Management REST API that allows saving and retrieving records describing the contents of a financial portfolio.

A web front-end will be built to interact with the API, allowing users to:
*   Browse a portfolio
*   View the performance of the portfolio (ideally in some graphical manner)
*   Add items to the portfolio
*   Remove items from the portfolio
